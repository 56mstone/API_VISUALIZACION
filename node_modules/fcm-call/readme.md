# Firebase Cloud Messaging
This package allows you to send notifications to your <b>android</b> device.

### Example

    let FCM = require('FCM');
    const serverKey = '<Your Server Key>'; 
    const referenceKey = '<Your reference key>'; //Device Key
    let title = '<Your notification title here.>';
    let message = '<Your message here>';

    FCM.FCM(serverKey, referenceKey, title, message);

From the above code, you can easily send PushNotification to your dedicated Device easily. :)

<b>You can also pass json inside message.</b>

    let FCM = require('FCM');
    const serverKey = '<Your Server Key>';
    message = { 
                "to": '<Your reference key>',
                "notification": {
                    "title": '<Your Title>', 
                    "body": '<Your Body>',
                    "sound": true,
                    "alert": true,
                }
    FCM.FCM(serverKey, message);

This aslo will give you a same result. As well as you can also customise notification using it.

Happy Notification! :)
